## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The coding was not difficult, but debugging a forgotten ":" took 15-20 mins to figure out for the refresh control portion. Customizing the UI took a lot of experimenting. The property to dismiss the keyboard on table swipe took a while to find. Hiding search bar took most of the time (2 hours maybe) as I was trying to do it with UITableView's scrollToRowAtIndex instead of using the setContentOffset.
